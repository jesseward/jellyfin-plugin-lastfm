Enables audio scrobbling to Last.FM as well as a metadata fetcher source.

This plug-in was migrated from the original Emby repository and has been adapted to function within the Jellyfin ecosystem. This plugin *cannot* be distributed with Jellyfin due to a missing compatible license. I will attempt to keep this repo up-to-date and in-sync as the Jellyfin project matures.

## 🔧 Installation and Configuration

Install the plugin via the Jellyfin plugin repository (see: [announcement](https://jellyfin.org/posts/plugin-updates/)). Navigate to `plugins` section of the admin dashboard, add the following repository to follow stable builds for this plugin.
* Repo name: LastFM Stable
* Repo URL: https://jellyfin-repo.jesseward.com/manifest.json
